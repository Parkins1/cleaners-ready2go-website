# Cleaners Ready 2 GO — Dev Guide

This repo uses a React (Vite) client + Express (ESM) server with shared types. For how to work in this codebase (by humans or AI agents), read `AGENTS.md` first — it replaces ad‑hoc change logs and defines conventions and guardrails.

- Start dev: `npm run dev`
- Type check: `npm run check`
- Build (client + server): `npm run build`
- Start prod build: `npm start`
- Smoke tests: `npm test`

See `AGENTS.md` for architecture, conventions, performance/accessibility rules, and PR template details.
