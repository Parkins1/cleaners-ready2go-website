# Risks & Mitigation Strategies

This document identifies potential risks associated with the new ContactForm feature and outlines mitigation plans.

## 1. CSS Conflicts
Risk:
- New Tailwind utility classes or custom CSS may clash with existing global styles, causing layout or styling regressions.

Mitigation:
- Namespace custom styles using component-specific class prefixes (e.g., `.contact-form-*`).
- Review Tailwind purge/`content` patterns to ensure unused styles are removed.
- Add visual regression tests (e.g., Percy, Chromatic) focusing on key pages (Contact, Home).

## 2. API Contract Changes
Risk:
- Backend schema updates (Zod schema or storage signature) could break the frontend POST expectations, leading to submission errors or data loss.

Mitigation:
- Pin shared Zod schema versions and import types directly from `@shared/schema`.
- Add integration tests for `/api/contacts` endpoint that run in CI on every pull request.
- Implement semantic versioning for `shared/schema` and enforce breaking-change review.

## 3. Performance Impact
Risk:
- Additional JavaScript (React Hook Form, React Query mutation, validation logic) could increase bundle size and slow initial page load.

Mitigation:
- Use Vite’s bundle analyzer plugin to monitor bundle size changes.
- Lazy-load the ContactForm component using React’s `lazy` & `Suspense`.
- Ensure minimal dependencies by pruning unused Radix or icon imports.

## 4. Accessibility Regressions
Risk:
- New form markup and error-message patterns may not meet WCAG standards, affecting users with assistive technologies.

Mitigation:
- Add automated a11y tests using Axe or Lighthouse in CI.
- Conduct manual screen-reader walkthroughs after implementation.
- Include ARIA attributes and `aria-live` regions for error announcements.

## 5. Network & Error Handling
Risk:
- Network failures or server downtime could cause form submission to fail silently or stall.

Mitigation:
- Display clear offline or retry notifications when the fetch fails.
- Configure retry logic in React Query (e.g., `retry: 1`).
- Monitor API latency and error rates via observability tools (Datadog, Sentry).

## 6. Rollout and Rollback
Risk:
- Rolling out the new form indiscriminately may expose users to untested flows.

Mitigation:
- Use the `VITE_USE_NEW_CONTACT_FORM` feature flag to enable gradual rollouts.
- Deploy to staging and validate smoke tests before production.
- Apply immediate rollback process outlined in `docs/rollback_mechanism.md`.
